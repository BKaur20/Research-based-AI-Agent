Self-love is the practice of caring for one�s own well-being and happiness. It involves positive self-regard and acceptance of oneself, recognizing one�s worth and value as a person. Self-love is often considered essential for mental health and emotional resilience, allowing individuals to navigate challenges more effectively. It is differentiated from narcissism, which can stem from a lack of self-love.
